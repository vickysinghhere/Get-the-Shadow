Given an unsorted array A[] of size N of positive integers. One number 'a' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'b' occurs twice in array. The task is to find the repeating and the missing.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print b, which is the repeating number, followed by a, which is the missing number, in a single line.

Example:
Input:
2
2
2 2
3 
1 3 3

Output:
2 1
3 2
